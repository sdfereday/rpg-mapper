# What is this? #

RPG Mapper is basically a tool that generates a map array with multiple layers. This is designed to take some of the complexity away from creating an array mapping of your level. It also has an ROT feature so you can use that to generate your level foundations.

**Where has this project reached?**

RPG Mapper started out as a simple tooling for myself to use on a game project. After recently updating it I realised that the thing is way out of date and is in dire need of a library swap. KO.js is just too old and too unmaintained to continue.

The plan is to convert this over to react since that's what I deal in mostly now. A lot of it was already remade in a prototype running React but could do with a better polish up and thus will be restarted with cleaner code written.

This means I am concluding this readme update as the last commit for this version. Future versions will see moving over to React.
